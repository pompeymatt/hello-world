Learning GIT basics

Helle World, Matt here! 

So a bit about me: 
I've messed around with coding over the years from Fortran, C, Perl, shell scripting etc to m,ore recently starting to learn Python. I've never been what I'd consider to be a competent coder but I am usually capable of hacking something together to do what I want!
I've also messed with git before but in a very un-informed, unstructured way so now I'm trying to learn with a bit of rigour and will combine with my attempts at learning Python!
